# Bootcampspot
### :octocat: A redesigned version of the Bootcampspot portal used by Trilogy Education, using following technologies: MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, Tailwind CSS.


Bootcampspot is a portal where coding bootcamp students can see their schedule, grades, attendance and submit required courseworks. With this redesigned version of the bootcampspot, I kept the features that were already done by the current bootcampspot, but also aimed to change the site into a semi-social network, where students can design their own profiles, see each others profiles and make announcements to their own classmates. 

## How It Works
